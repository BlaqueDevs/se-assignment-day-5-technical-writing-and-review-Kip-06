Different people process technical info in different ways. If you present complex details to non-tech people, they’ll get confused. If you keep it too basic for tech experts, they’ll lose interest or think you don’t know enough.
## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?
1. know your audience
2. Adjust your language
3. Focus on what matters to them

a. Ask questions upfront
b. Watch for clues
c. Start with a baseline explanation
d. Use anologies
e. Offer Options
f. Look at their background

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
1. Use simple, everyday language
